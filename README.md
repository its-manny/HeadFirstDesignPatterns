# Java Design Patterns
A repo of completed exercised and notes relating to my study of "Head First Design Patterns - 2nd Edition"
## Patterns
### Strategy
> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy 
> lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.
### Observer
> Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependants are 
> notified and updated automatically.
### Decorator
> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing
> for extending functionality.
### Factory
> Defines as interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method
> lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
